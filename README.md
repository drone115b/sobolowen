# A Tabular Hash for Owen Scrambling

Here, we implement the Sobol Sequence with Owen Scrambling for up to 32 dimensions.  Stateless and stateful generators are supplied.  The method of scrambling is new.

- main.cpp # toy to demonstrate sample generation
- sobolowen.cpp/h # C++ for Sobol/Owen sample generation

Use "make" to verify everything compiles and works properly
